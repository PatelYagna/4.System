# 4.System
This a something an operating system from the old eras. It does basic tasks and has a few games. 


In this project I explored some new libraries, and implemented my past projects. Creating did take a while, however, I learned many new things that will be used in other projects. A prime example of this is creating the file, then writing in the, and saving it. I want to see what more I can do with the haslib library and the file creating. In this project some parts were extremly easy as I only had to copy and past my older projects.

As I build my catalog I explore new libraries, but recently a friend told me that many times creating your own functions, and libraries is much more important as many libraries don't have the exactly what is needed. So, for my future projects I will learn new libraries, but also focus on writing my own functions.
